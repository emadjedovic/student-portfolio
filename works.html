        <h2>Augustin Louis Cauchy: A Biography</h2>
        <h4>High School Graduation Project [01/2021]</h4>
        <p>As a part of my high school education at Saint Francis Catholic School Center in Tuzla, I conducted an in-depth study on the life and contributions of Augustin Louis Cauchy, a prominent mathematician of the 19th century.</p>

        <section>
            <div><br>This paper's theme is the prominent mathematician Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789–1857). The first chapter elaborates on Cauchy's biography from his education, mathematical works and accomplishments to public relations and acquired reputation among scientific circles. In the second chapter, we delve into his contribution to the mathematical field in more detail with concrete examples from areas such as series convergence. Finally, we list some of Cauchy's more famous published works accompanied by images. The motivation for writing about this great mathematician is the controversy associated with him and the considerable number of published works of great importance for modern science.<br>

        <h2>Changing Attitudes on Same-Sex Relationships</h2>
        <h4>Sociology Research [05/2020]</h4>

        <section>
            <div>
                <p>This research paper explores the historical evolution of attitudes towards same-sex relationships, with a particular emphasis on the changing perceptions of older generations. The study hypothesizes that older generations were generally less accepting of same-sex relationships, perceiving them as foreign and absurd concepts, largely due to a lack of information and understanding.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the paper posits that homophobia was more prevalent in the past, with the prevailing belief that individuals within the LGBT community had a disorder and should be treated. However, in contemporary society, such attitudes are widely considered socially unacceptable.</p>
                <p>The research also highlights the influential role played by the media in transforming societal views on same-sex relationships. It demonstrates that the media has been instrumental in dismantling homophobia by providing information, promoting understanding, and advocating for the acceptance of same-sex marriages.</p>
                </div>

            <p>By examining the historical and social context, this research contributes to a better understanding of how societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have changed over time. It underscores the importance of increased awareness, education, and media representation in fostering acceptance and equal treatment for the LGBT community.<br>

        <h2>A Linear Program for Minimizing Air Pollution Considering Environmental Impact, Costs and Employment.</h2>
        <h4>An Operations Research Project [12/2023]</h4>

        <section>
            <div>
                <p>
                This operations research project focuses on the development of a linear program with the aim of minimizing air pollution in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while simultaneously optimizing costs and taking into account the social aspect. Through precisely defined decision variables, the objective function, and constraints, the research covers a wide spectrum of factors in the energy sector.</p>

                <p>Decision variables include the quantity of different energy sources, the number of installed alternative energy sources, and the number of employees at various production and installation facilities. The objective function combines the goals of minimizing pollution, costs, and the number of employees, considering the prices of energy sources, installations, and maintenance, and emphasizing social responsibility.</p>

            </div>

            <img src="images/lp-pocetna.png" alt="linear-program-png">
            
            <p>Limitations encompass parameters such as the availability of energy sources, production of thermal energy, restrictions on the installation of alternative sources, budget constraints, and conditions for the number of employees. By analyzing prices, resource efficiency, and social factors, the project aims to achieve a sustainable solution that not only minimizes negative environmental impacts but also promotes economic sustainability and social development.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, the project aims to contribute to global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, thereby contributing to environmental preservation and the long-term sustainability of the energy sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br>
