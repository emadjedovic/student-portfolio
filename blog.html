        <h2>'The most disruptive force in history': Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk discuss the future of AI</h2>
        <h4 title="Summary" style="cursor: default;">The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, had a conversation with Elon Musk for the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. They discussed political and social impacts of the technology, with Musk labelling 'digital super intelligence' as 'the most disruptive force in history', and agreeing that government oversight is essential</h4>

        <h3 id="a1s1">Developing AI safely</h3>
        <p>Sunak opened the discussion by quoting Bill Gates, who once hailed Musk as someone who has done more to push the limits of science and innovation in our times. He went on to ask Musk to share his thoughts on how it felt to be held in such high regard by Gates. He soon shifted his focus to AI, on which, for nearly a decade, he has been talking about how the world needs to practise caution with AI to make it safe. Musk also acknowledged the progress in AI, adding that there is a proactive need to mitigate potential risks.</p>

        <h3 id="a1s2">Governments as referee</h3>
        <p>Talking about the AI Safety Summit, Musk said that he felt it is good for governments to play an active role when it comes to public safety. With the rise of digital superintelligence, Musk said that there was a need for governments to play the role of 'referee' to make sure there is sportsman-like conduct and public safety concerns are addressed efficiently. He went on to say that he has been familiar with regulators in cars, aviation and rockets. While he agreed with most regulations, there were less than 1 per cent that he disagreed with. Addressing the concerns from Silicon Valley over regulations, Musk maintained that having a referee was good, just like in sports. He also said that even without regulations of enforcement capabilities, governments simply highlighting concerns can be powerful.</p>

        <h3 id="a1s3">On the impact of AI on jobs</h3>
        <p>Musk called AI the most disruptive force in history. According to him, for the first time, something will be smarter than the smartest human. Finding meaning in life will be challenging. He cited the Olympics, saying how humans compete with each other to be the best human, and there is meaning in that.</p>

        <h3 id="a1s4">AI as tutors and companions</h3>
        <p>The Tesla CEO also said that AI tutors could be 'amazing'. He said AI can be the most patient tutor on any subject. He said that they can be great for companionship, essentially an AI friend with memory of all your interactions, reading everything about you, talking to you every day, etc. The 52-year-old said that for those with learning disabilities or having trouble making friends, an AI friend could be a great asset.</p>

        <h3 id="a1s5">AI as an enabler</h3>
        <p>Musk spoke about perseverance, saying that if your first start-up fails, that should not be the end of your career. While saying that stock options are difficult in Europe, Musk said that start-ups are high-risk and high-reward. He also said that social media platforms are facing challenges from AI bots that are capable of passing captcha tests and manipulating information. According to him, a minor cost to use platforms could be of great help in combating bots, essentially making it expensive to create fake accounts. </p>

        <h3 id="a1s6">On gaining public trust</h3>
        <p>Sunak asked about the critical nature of managing information integrity. The X chief said that authentication of real vs AI-created media could be beneficial to gaining public trust and addressing the problem of misinformation. He cited that entertainment content, like the Pope in a Balenciaga puffer jacket, is still believed to be true by many. Musk said that, with AI, there was an 80 per cent likelihood of being net positive, and if we are cognizant about the 20 per cent downside risk, then, AI could be a great equaliser.</p>

        <h3 id="a2s2">Programming languages ranking 2023</h3>
        <p>Let's take a closer look at the most used programming languages in 2023:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Python</li>
                    <p>Python is an open source programming language, initially designed by the Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in 1991. It is powerful, user-friendly and easy to learn. Python is used in many fields such as Machine Learning (ML), automation and scientific computing. It can also serve as a scripting language for web applications. Furthermore, there are diverse Python frameworks, like Django, TurboGears and Flask, that support developers in the development of complex applications.</p>
                <li>JavaScript (JS)</li>
                    <p>JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the WWW, together with HTML and CSS. It was initially developed by the American computer programmer Brendan Eich, at Netscape, in 1995. It is a must-have among software developers and a great starting point for beginners. JavaScript must not be confused with Java, although both of them have a C-like syntax and JS was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind.</p>
                <li>Java</li>
                    <p>Java was originally designed by the Canadian computer scientist James Gosling, while working at Sun Microsystems, in 1995. It is a particularly popular programming language for server-client web applications.</p>
                <li>HTML</li>
                    <p>The markup language HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, was initially designed by the British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Used in combination with CSS and JavaScript, HTML is used by web browsers to compose visual web pages.</p>
                <li>CSS</li>
                    <p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language, developed by W3C in 1996. It is used to format documents written in HTML or XML. So, as well as HTML and JavaScript, it is a cornerstone of the WWW.</p>
                <li>SQL</li>
                    <p>SQL, short for Structured Query Language, was initially designed by the American computer scientists Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in 1974. It is a declarative programming language used for data management in relational database management systems (RDBMS). MySQL, MariaDB and Microsoft SQL Server are some of the most popular RDBMS nowadays</p>
                <li>C#</li>
                    <p>C# (C Sharp) is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language, initially designed by the Danish software engineer Anders Hejlsberg, while working at Microsoft, in 2000. It is used for developing web services, web, mobile and desktop applications, and games</p>
                <li>C</li>
                    <p>C is a general-purpose programming language, originally designed by the American computer scientist Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s. It stands out for the efficiency of its code. C is widely used for developing system software, creating applications and on a wide range of computer architectures — from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
                <li>C++</li>
                    <p>C++ was initially developed by the Danish computer  scientist Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, as an extension of C. It is often used in software infrastructure, desktop applications, servers, etc.</p>
                <li>TypeScript</li>
                    <p>TypeScript is an open source programming language, first released in 2012 by Microsoft. It is designed for developing large applications, JavaScript applications for client-side and server-side execution, etc.</p>
                <li>PHP</li>
                    <p>PHP is a scripting language intended for web development on the server side. It was initially designed by the Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994-1995. It is also used for creating dynamic web page content and many other programming tasks such as robotic drone control.</p>
                <li>R</li>
                    <p>R is a programming language, initially developed by the New Zealander statistician Ross Ihaka and the Canadian statistician Robert Gentleman in 1993. It is very popular in statistical computing and graphics, for performing data analysis and developing statistical software.</p>
                <li>Bash/Shell</li>
                    <p>The command language and Unix shell Bash is the GNU Project's shell. It was designed as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell by the American programmer Brian Fox, in 1989. Since then, most Linux distributions use it as the default login shell.</p>
                <li>Swift</li>
                    <p>Swift is an open source programming language, originally designed by Chris Lattner, Doug Gregor, John McCall, Ted Kremenek, Joe Groff and Apple Inc. It was created as a replacement for Objective-C for developing MacOS and iOS applications. This language presents a simpler syntax and includes modern programming languages theory concepts.</p>
                <li>Objective-C</li>
                    <p>Objective-C is a general-purpose programming language, initially designed by Tom Love and Brad Cox in the early 1980s. It enables the creation of easy and flexible solutions to programming problems. Until the arrival of Swift in 2014, Objective-C was the main language supported by Apple for MacOS and iOS applications, and their respective APIs.</p>
            </ol>
        <p>According to the PYPL ranking, Python, Java and JavaScript also led the ranking of the most popular programming languages in 2022. But, according to Stack Overflow's 2022 Developer Survey, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and SQL were last year's top three programming languages among respondents.</p>

        <h2>Quantum Computing Advance Begins New Era, IBM Says</h2>
        <h4>A quantum computer came up with better answers to a physics problem than a conventional supercomputer.</h4>

        <figure>
            <p><img class="image" src="images/a3_image1.webp" alt="quantum_computer"></p>
            <figcaption><i>A model of the interior of a quantum computer at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.</i></figcaption>
        </figure><br>

        <p>Quantum computers today are small in computational scope — the chip inside your smartphone contains billions of transistors while the most powerful quantum computer contains a few hundred of the quantum equivalent of a transistor. They are also unreliable. If you run the same calculation over and over, they will most likely churn out different answers each time.</p>

        <p>But with their intrinsic ability to consider many possibilities at once, quantum computers do not have to be very large to tackle certain prickly problems of computation, and on Wednesday, IBM researchers announced that they had devised a method to manage the unreliability in a way that would lead to reliable, useful answers.</p>

        <p>A team of IBM scientists who work for Dr. Gambetta <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06096-3" target="_blank">their results in a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.</a></p>

        <p>Present-day computers are called digital, or classical, because they deal with bits of information that are either 1 or 0, on or off. A quantum computer performs calculations on quantum bits, or qubits, that capture a more complex state of information. Just as a thought experiment by the physicist Erwin Schrödinger postulated that a cat could be in a quantum state that is both dead and alive, a qubit can be both 1 and 0 simultaneously.</p>

        <figure>
            <p><img class="image" src="images/a3_image2.webp" alt="processor"></p>
            <figcaption><i>The 127-qubit IBM Eagle quantum processor used in the experiment.</i></figcaption>
        </figure><br>

        <p>That allows quantum computers to make many calculations in one pass, while digital ones have to perform each calculation separately. By speeding up computation, quantum computers could potentially solve big, complex problems in fields like chemistry and materials science that are out of reach today. Quantum computers could also have a darker side by threatening privacy through algorithms that break the protections used for passwords and encrypted communications.</p>

        <p>When Google researchers made their supremacy claim in 2019, they said their quantum computer performed a calculation in 3 minutes 20 seconds that would take about 10,000 years on a state-of-the-art conventional supercomputer.A team of Chinese researchers was able to perform the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3458817.3487399" target="_blank">the same calculation on a non-quantum supercomputer in just over five minutes</a>, far quicker than the 10,000 years the Google team had estimated</p>

        <p>The IBM researchers in the new study performed a different task, one that interests physicists. They used a quantum processor with 127 qubits to simulate the behavior of 127 atom-scale bar magnets — tiny enough to be governed by the spooky rules of quantum mechanics — in a magnetic field. That is a simple system known as the Ising model, which is often used to study magnetism.</p>

        <p>This problem is too complex for a precise answer to be calculated even on the largest, fastest supercomputers. On the quantum computer, the calculation took less than a thousandth of a second to complete. Each quantum calculation was unreliable — fluctuations of quantum noise inevitably intrude and induce errors — but each calculation was quick, so it could be performed repeatedly.</p>

        <p>The researchers were able to subtract the effects of noise from the unreliable quantum calculations, a process they call error mitigation. “You have to bypass that by inventing very clever ways to mitigate the noise,” Dr. Aharonov said. “And this is what they do.” Altogether, the computer performed the calculation 600,000 times, converging on an answer for the overall magnetization produced by the 127 bar magnets.</p>

        <figure>
            <p><img class="image" src="images/a3_image3.webp" alt="research_lab"></p>
            <figcaption><i>Working with the low temperature system in the IBM Quantum Experimental Research Lab.</i></figcaption>
        </figure><br>

        <p>Certain configurations of the Ising model can be solved exactly, and both the classical and quantum algorithms agreed on the simpler examples. For more complex but solvable instances, the quantum and classical algorithms produced different answers, and it was the quantum one that was correct.</p>

        <p>Thus, for other cases where the quantum and classical calculations diverged and no exact solutions are known, “there is reason to believe that the quantum result is more accurate,” said Sajant Anand, a graduate student at Berkeley who did much of the work on the classical approximations.</p>

        <p>Error correction is already used in conventional computers and data transmission to fix garbles. But for quantum computers, error correction is likely years away, requiring better processors able to process many more qubits.</p>

        <p>Error mitigation, the IBM scientists believe, is an interim solution that can be used now for increasingly complex problems beyond the Ising model.</p>
